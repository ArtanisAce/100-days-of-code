### Day 12: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, sort by travel date order functional. Full functional, except for optional pagination

### Day 13: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, added component to render svgs which control sort order on review date and travel date

**Thoughts:** There's a discussion about using SVG on img tags, inline or object. Seems like adding as inline can give more flexibility, mostly for controlling CSS

### Day 14: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, added more css and flex display for some components

### Day 16: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, refactored components, added scroll to bottom when calculations appear

**Thoughts:** Is a decent app with not much boilerplate, probably more refactor could be done. Adding a preprocessor like SASS could help

**Today's Progress**: Retaking frontend app 'movie-list'. Refactored and added some style to navigation, inspired on CSS course nav bar video

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Really small changes, most of the time has been investigating about architectural design

to movie-list, and kept watching 'Mastering CSS' course, while writting down some important CSS tips.

**Thoughts:** Will continue watching the video till is ended, and will combine courses/articles and coding on the same session. On weekends will extend the coding sessions, or days that I don't have
much to do

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Refactored some css code, added movies svg, continued working on nav bar

### Day 30: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Extracted MovieBox into a component, need to try and refactor

**Thoughts:** Styled components should be the last step of a component, like container -> structural -> presentational (styled). Dont wrap structural components in a styled component

### Day 31: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Searching for articles, learning on ES6 Proxy. Made some practice on the console

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Extracted MovieBox into a component, rendered through MovieList component (also presentational, refactored MovieList -> UserList)

### Day 33: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Fixed bug with add movie button on MovieBox

**Today's Progress**: Continued CSS course and frontend app 'movie-list'. Added webfonts, downloaded ones and google font ones

**Thoughts:** Couldnt make to inject the local fonts through S-C globalInject. Need to look into that again. Will continue with CSS and styled-components playing. After that, Redux, and then backend.

### Day 36: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Added more style for movie box.

### Day 37: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS course. Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Fixed injectGlobal issue, added width: 100% to img tags.

**Thoughts:** We will convert the SVGs from being loaded through images to inline SVG, as it's much more flexible and we can reduce the http requests. Consider using a sprite in the future when
the number of svgs gets bigger

### Day 38: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tiny session, fixed a wrong css rule on img holding the svg (width to max-widht), added react-svg to handle injection of svg inline.

**Thoughts:** Wonder how react-svg will work with S-C, hope className will work good. Will have to pass it as a prop on the s-c wrapper

### Day 40: February 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactor css, sanitized css, added style to searchbar

### Day 40: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactor css, added C-S ThemeProvider to emulate CSS variables (now passed as colors to components). Refactored css

### Day 41: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: AddMovieButton now transforms into text. Slight refactor, mostly searching about ways to animate on React components conditional rendering

**Thoughts:** Next session will implement ReactTransitionGroup to the addMovieButton, to handle animation when is replaced by text. Follow medium bookmarked article, install also gsap.
We'll prefer ReactTransitionGroup over ReactCSSTransitiongroup due that we're trying to not use vanilla CSS in classic way in any kind.

### Day 44: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added React Transitions custom component for the add movie button. Created a simple fade out

### Day 46: February 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the add button transition, added transition when button is clicked and text appear.

**Thoughts:** Im spending too much time with this, maybe there's a simpler way of solving it. Investigate more, solving it with React Transitions seems over complicated for such a thing

### Day 47: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched video on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov.

**Thoughts:** Might be useful to save state in localStorage to have a faster development time when testing the code in the UI

**Link to work:** -

### Day 48: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched video on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov (localStorage rehyration). Added this to the app, added throttle (lodash) and styled the addtext button
