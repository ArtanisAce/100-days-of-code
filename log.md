### Day 12: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, sort by travel date order functional. Full functional, except for optional pagination

### Day 13: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, added component to render svgs which control sort order on review date and travel date

**Thoughts:** There's a discussion about using SVG on img tags, inline or object. Seems like adding as inline can give more flexibility, mostly for controlling CSS

### Day 14: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, added more css and flex display for some components

### Day 16: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, refactored components, added scroll to bottom when calculations appear

**Thoughts:** Is a decent app with not much boilerplate, probably more refactor could be done. Adding a preprocessor like SASS could help

### Day 17: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Retaking frontend app 'movie-list'. Refactored and added some style to navigation, inspired on CSS course nav bar video

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Really small changes, most of the time has been investigating about architectural design

**Thoughts:** Decided to drop firebase idea and create a backend with a mongo db to save films, using then MERN stack. Graphql is not needed for now, could be reimplemented in the future

to movie-list, and kept watching 'Mastering CSS' course, while writting down some important CSS tips.

**Thoughts:** Will continue watching the video till is ended, and will combine courses/articles and coding on the same session. On weekends will extend the coding sessions, or days that I don't have
much to do

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Refactored some css code, added movies svg, continued working on nav bar

### Day 30: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Extracted MovieBox into a component, need to try and refactor

**Thoughts:** Styled components should be the last step of a component, like container -> structural -> presentational (styled). Dont wrap structural components in a styled component

### Day 31: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Searching for articles, learning on ES6 Proxy. Made some practice on the console

**Thoughts:** Proxy is a really useful tool for 'validation' on objects. Can see if I can use it in movie-lists to learn it better

**Link to work:** --

### Day 32: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Extracted MovieBox into a component, rendered through MovieList component (also presentational, refactored MovieList -> UserList)

**Thoughts:** This structure looks much better. Fix bug with the add movie button

### Day 33: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Fixed bug with add movie button on MovieBox

**Thoughts:** This structure looks much better, but... I think moving MovieBox to MovieList is a good idea, having a 'final' presentational component, and not two of them.

**Today's Progress**: Continued CSS course and frontend app 'movie-list'. Added webfonts, downloaded ones and google font ones

**Thoughts:** Couldnt make to inject the local fonts through S-C globalInject. Need to look into that again. Will continue with CSS and styled-components playing. After that, Redux, and then backend.

### Day 36: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Added more style for movie box.

**Thoughts:** Seems like breaking text in a box is not yet fully supported in CSS. JS is the most vible option

### Day 37: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS course. Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Fixed injectGlobal issue, added width: 100% to img tags.

**Thoughts:** We will convert the SVGs from being loaded through images to inline SVG, as it's much more flexible and we can reduce the http requests. Consider using a sprite in the future when
the number of svgs gets bigger

### Day 38: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tiny session, fixed a wrong css rule on img holding the svg (width to max-widht), added react-svg to handle injection of svg inline.

**Thoughts:** Wonder how react-svg will work with S-C, hope className will work good. Will have to pass it as a prop on the s-c wrapper

### Day 40: February 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactor css, sanitized css, added style to searchbar

### Day 40: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactor css, added C-S ThemeProvider to emulate CSS variables (now passed as colors to components). Refactored css

### Day 41: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: AddMovieButton now transforms into text. Slight refactor, mostly searching about ways to animate on React components conditional rendering

**Thoughts:** Next session will implement ReactTransitionGroup to the addMovieButton, to handle animation when is replaced by text. Follow medium bookmarked article, install also gsap.
We'll prefer ReactTransitionGroup over ReactCSSTransitiongroup due that we're trying to not use vanilla CSS in classic way in any kind.

### Day 44: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added React Transitions custom component for the add movie button. Created a simple fade out

### Day 46: February 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the add button transition, added transition when button is clicked and text appear.

**Thoughts:** Im spending too much time with this, maybe there's a simpler way of solving it. Investigate more, solving it with React Transitions seems over complicated for such a thing

### Day 47: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched video on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov.

**Thoughts:** Might be useful to save state in localStorage to have a faster development time when testing the code in the UI

**Link to work:** -

### Day 48: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched video on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov (localStorage rehyration). Added this to the app, added throttle (lodash) and styled the addtext button

**Thoughts:** Will keep working on the redux part of the project while watching videos. Need to have some filter on movie list or on searchResult to not add again movies you already did

**Link to work:** [Movie-Lists App](https://github.com/ArtanisAce/movie-lists), [Movie-Lists Backend] (https://github.com/ArtanisAce/movie-lists-backend)

### Day 49: February 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent time reviewing newsletters. Watched CSS Grid video, read about new React Context API, and promise.finally()

**Thoughts:** Sundays will be spent this way from now on. Might code just a little

**Link to work:** -

### Day 50: February 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov, made a general refactor of code (mostly styling)

**Thoughts:** Probably in the future will have to revisit videos to implement selectors (or use the state-of-the-art module for that)

**Link to work:** [Movie-Lists App](https://github.com/ArtanisAce/movie-lists), [Movie-Lists Backend] (https://github.com/ArtanisAce/movie-lists-backend)

### Day 51: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep watching videos on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov, made a general refactor on binding action creators to the components (could eliminate bindActionCreators)

**Thoughts:** Im spending too much time on refactoring and looking over redux, not many code changes last days... need to finish series and move forward!

**Link to work:** [Movie-Lists App](https://github.com/ArtanisAce/movie-lists), [Movie-Lists Backend] (https://github.com/ArtanisAce/movie-lists-backend)

### Day 52: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep watching videos on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov, went through an accesibility checklist and added aria landmarks and title on SVGs

**Thoughts:** Keep working on accesibility and have in mind always when building apps! Also, should go through some security checklist (maybe after backend is ended).

### Day 53: March 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Keep watching videos on 'Idiomatic Redux' by Dan Abramov, went through an accesibility checklist and checked color contrast. Added Formik

**Thoughts:** Friday nights are always impossible xD Tomorrow more and better with Formik (which sounds like a spray to kill ants or sthing)

### Day 54: March 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added basic form with Formik, full functional for now but not connected to redux.

**Thoughts:** I won't ever touch redux-form again, even with a stick. Formik looks great! Needs to be connected still to react-redux.

### Day 55: March 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Look on articles (read one about color contrast and fonts accesibility). Prepared bundle for monday

**Thoughts:** Sunday should keep like this! :)

**Link to work:** -

### Day 56: March 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Kept watching 'Idiomatic Redux'

**Thoughts:** Thought about changing state structure on the app; maybe we could have selectors for every part of the movie state? Then we could do all the operations on them,

and pass only pure state that will get rendered to the components (instead of passing the whole raw object to state and then inject it).

### Day 57: March 6, 2018

### Day 61: March 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored code, handled error state correctly, but still needs to be cleared when the corresponding action is finally resolved succesfully.

**Thoughts:** Need to separate error state in 2 probably (for fetching movie search results, and config - for now), and add SUCCESS action types. Need to add the isFetching state yet.

### Day 64: March 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: General refactor on code, separated errors in config and search errors

### Day 65: March 15, 2018

### Day 66: March 15, 2018

### Day 69: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through articles and last fun fun function video

**Thoughts:** react-router and react-transition-group can create really smooth and nice effects for web apps. Context might just kick out Redux in most cases, and graphQL is really awesome
when you have some control over the backend. Houdini... seems really powerful!

**Link to work:** -

### Day 70: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to set up different boilerplates. At the end, came back to the exact same point of day 68...

**Thoughts:** Let's start with a simple boilerplate app, and add things when is needed; that's better aswell to learn how things work and why work that way. Probably will just need passport and mongoose.

**Thoughts:** So much time wasted on boilerplates and searching for the right setup... finally I think I have it. Tomorrow, move tmdb API requests logic into backend, axios to fetch maybe? To frontend
and backend

### Day 72: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added axios (both frontend and backend), started refactor of tmdb requests (moving them to backend endpoints)

**Thoughts:** Will have to review about this param, probably syntax in APIUtils.js (movie-lists) is not correct when passing it.

### Day 73: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored tmdb requests, now fully working with backend API as proxy. Added loading indicator on SearchResults, still not spinning

### Day 74: March 24, 2018

### Day 75: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Handle errors correctly now in both frontend / backend. Loading indicator spins indefinitely now. Started working on Movie component

**Thoughts:** Good read online about handling errors in backend and frontend, things more clear now. Need to change the way we save data in user list to show full movie details (right now we save a small part of data).

### Day 76: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Connected the MovieWrapper component to the state, after creating the reducer and the action creator (which accesses the store state to get the full movie details)

**Thoughts:** Nice to know more info about thunk and issues it might take with some approaches, and specifically for the problem I tried to solve. I decided to take the approach though, don't
think can create further problems for the application I'm trying to complete.

### Day 77: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created Movie component, defined state object that will be passed (through the selector). Refactor server on backend using a tmdb request help function.

### Day 79: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied a basic CSS Grid to the Movie component; rewatched a bit of 'CSS Grid: the Big Picture' video.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid seems so powerful, need to practice more with it and unveil what things can it do

### Day 80: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied a basic CSS Grid to the Movie component, now looking much better. Finished rewatching a bit of 'CSS Grid: the Big Picture' video. Watched
another video by Jen Simmons about Grid, took a deeper look into css-tricks grid cheatsheet and read more info online on the matter.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid seems so powerful, want to take another day and try to apply through areas maybe, using fr as size unit.

### Day 82: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added find polyfill, messed around with -ms-grid implementation but doesn't really work out, so added the feature queries and will
create the layout for Movie in IE in another way than CSS Grid. Watched Jen Simmons videos, learned about viewport units

**Thoughts:** Need to layout the Movie page with floats probably. Maybe experiment with viewport units somewhere in the app.

### Day 83: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed style bugs in IE with flexbox and css Grid. Now should look the same on the 3 browsers (Chrome, FF, IE)

**Thoughts:** The Grid layout on Movie needs to be refactored and centered, doesn't look so good

### Day 83: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Make a quick change on grid layout for Movie component, centering the elements.

**Thoughts:** Looks better, still the page is very poor with spaces and lack of content. Was just an exercise for grid, so is enough

### Day 85: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through the website, noted down things that needed to be changed. Decided on new font, and surfed through web design page to get inspiration

**Thoughts:** Talked to the owner to get a separate repository with only the website content, thus will be easier to work with (wrapping git around aswell)

**Link to work:** -

### Day 86: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up repo for the project, tried to split it up on the parts I'm going to manipulate. Went through 'web dev interview questions'

### Day 86: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up repo for the project (again), after I can finally run the site locally. Added font, verify I can make changes and they're reflected

**Thoughts:** Now we can finally start! Probably thinking on some general refactor, maybe adding CSS variables to hold the main colors etc?

### Day 87: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made some simple animations on the header

### Day 88: April 12, 2018
