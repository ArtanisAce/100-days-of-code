**Today's Progress**: Continue fullstack task, added component to render svgs which control sort order on review date and travel date

**Today's Progress**: Continued frontend app 'movie-list'. Fixed indentation problem on github (converted everything to 2 spaces instead of 2 tabs). Also did that on reviews-app. Added some CSS
to movie-list, and kept watching 'Mastering CSS' course, while writting down some important CSS tips.

**Thoughts:** Will continue watching the video till is ended, and will combine courses/articles and coding on the same session. On weekends will extend the coding sessions, or days that I don't have
much to do
