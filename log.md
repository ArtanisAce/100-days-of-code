# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started reviews-app as a fullstack exercise; searched for simple react and node/express boilerplate and followed steps.

**Thoughts:** Need to get hands on know how webpack works, and better understand how servers work with bundles
